## Transcript

**0:03** · \[music\] \[music\] Hello. Hello. Hello. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you all had a wonderful lunch. Um there's so many of you as well. I'm actually kind of surprised by this. Um happy to see that there's that much interest in talking about uh Evals.

**0:31** · Um I personally am a big fan of anything Evals related.

**0:38** · But I know not everyone's That's not everyone's cup of tea, right? Um so very happy to see this many people of you. Um So yeah, this So today's session is really going to be about Evals. Um and I guess my goal for this session is for you all to be afterwards to be inspired to build Evals, to be like, "Okay, Evals are actually really useful."

**0:59** · Um and how you can act on them, right?

**1:01** · Like, we're going to be building Evals.

**1:04** · I want you to get a better sense of like, "Okay, how should I be thinking about building Evals? What are useful type of Evals? And then also, how can we use and take these Evals to then make better agents, right?" So that's the main goal of this session.

**1:20** · Um and the way we're going to do this is by building a slide generation agent and then finding out like, "Okay, what are some good Evals? What do we want to measure? And then, how can we build now better agents based on the feedback that we're getting from our Evals?"

**1:37** · And the first thing that we all need to set the stage on is, "What are Evals, right?"

**1:44** · So Evals are systematic tests that measure how well an AI system performs on a specific domain or use case, right?

**1:53** · So they give you information about like, "What's the quality of the results? Um what did it do well? What was it not good at? How can we improve, right?

**2:01** · And evals they are made up of tasks define certain scenarios that then encode certain expectations through the grading logic. So, one way that we're thinking about evals is if you for example are building an AI system and AI agent and you want to make sure that the output adheres to like a certain type of quality or you want need to make sure like this must always be present.

**2:28** · Evals are a way to kind of encode this behavior in a way where then afterwards, if your evals fail, you know like, okay, my agent is not doing or behaving the way it is intended, right? So, that's the way how we can use these evals.

**2:43** · And then evals is also the bridge between things like it seems to work or like we know it works or maybe it's all like, ah, it kind of feels a little bit worse today for some reason.

**2:55** · It's always very hard to act on these types of vibes, right? Like I think vibes definitely have their own place. I think they're useful just to get like a general sense check of like how people are feeling. But they're not very actionable, right? And that's kind of what you want to get out of evals. We want to have something that's actionable.

**3:15** · So, then we always ship eval. Like we always once we release like a model, we always have this accompanying benchmark scorecard, right? And then we always list like, oh, these are like a bunch of evals. This is what we achieve, what our models achieve. We compare them to other models. We compare them to competitor models, right? Um And there's like always a few usual suspects, right? Like for example, um SweetBench is a very famous one which measures agentic coding abilities.

**3:45** · Terminal Bench is one that's also quite popular. But we also have other types of evals, right? We have like tool use and agents like for example like Tower Bench, OSWorld, which are some other evals that measure different things. And then we also have like reasoning and knowledge um like Arc-AGI too.

**4:00** · Um Now, this is all fine and dandy, right?

**4:03** · And then you look at these evals and we always every time a new model releases like, "Oh, we stopped off the benchmark for these and these um evals, right?" Um and they give us like a general general sense of like how well is the model and how much did we improve upon previous versions, right?

**4:20** · But for you guys, if you're like building something, if you're building an agentic system, this doesn't really say much usually, right? Like because like we we don't measure for example like a very specific use case that you guys are building on, right? We measure these generic general benchmark that measure a lot of capabilities, but they might not be applicable to your specific use case, right?

**4:44** · So, that's why we always say build your own evals, benchmark the different models, benchmark your AI agent, and make sure that you get the most out of the models, and make sure that you're also using the right model for the job.

**4:56** · Right?

**4:59** · And so, why are these evals specifically important? So, this is my pitch to you of start using evals, right? So, without evals, suppose you don't have evals. I think we've all been into the scenario where you have like this agent and it's working fine, and then you get like this feedback of like a customer who is like saying like, uh it's it's not really up to par of like this new model switch, ma it's something is off, right? It's very hard like to do anything with that information, right?

**5:27** · It's just like, "Okay, um do you have some logs maybe that we can take a look at some specific instances, right?" And then you try to like debug it manually, right?

**5:37** · But in a way, you're still flying blind, right? You're always in a reactive loop, so you wait for the feedback and then you're like, "Okay, let's see what we can do about this, right?" So, you basically only catch issues in production. You can fix, for example, like one issue, which then might, for example, create multiple more down the line by making, I don't know, prompt change tweak that suddenly degrades the capabilities on like other tasks that you haven't even considered.

**6:01** · Um it's it's also quite annoying to distinguish like genuine feedback from noise, right? Um which is always you don't want to act on every single thing that you see because people have also some um biases in the way they perceive these things, right? Um And then finally, I think which is the most important one is there's no way to verify improvements or regressions on anything that you're building or that you've done, right? So, you like need a way to make sure that the changes that you are making to your agent are actually impacting the quality and making sure that you improve upon the previous versions, right?

**6:33** · And so, this is basically what evals do give you. If you add evals, you have clarity. You need to define what does success look like, right? Because like if let's say you don't have evals, right? And you're not even able to articulate like this is how the agent should behave. This is what the successful end product would look like for my agent, then how can you make sure that your agent's actually behaving properly because you can't even vocalize it to yourself like this is what it should be. So, building these evals forces you to define, formalize in a way what you expect your agent to do.

**7:05** · Um It also allows you, as I said, to iterate on optimal agent configs.

**7:10** · Um you can also adopt new models faster, right? Instead of like saying like oh, we might test out this new model and then see if it's like okay. You now have like some clarity to say like okay, this is better on this and this is not better on this and this is why we should or should not migrate to a new model. Which especially I think is quite relevant with the pace of new models coming out.

**7:32** · I think it's also like just taking this load off your back of always constantly having to find like okay, what is the new frontier, right? Um And then finally, making problems visible before launch, right? So, you know, like, oh, if there's like a few um cases that you have that we always do well or that you trust to provide a lot of insight, that's where you get the most value out of evals.

**7:57** · And so, how how do evals really fit in?

**7:59** · So, originally, um when we were like thinking about like prompt engineering, we had this basically this flow of like how you should optimize a prompt, right?

**8:08** · So, first you develop your test cases, which are the evals in the end. Then you write like a prompt, you test out the prompt against the tasks, you refine the prompt a little bit, and then it goes back, you run the prompt again, you refine it until you're like, "Okay, I'm doing good great on my evals. I'm confident that my system is working properly." And then finally, you can like ship the post polished prompt, right? Um over time, systems have gotten a lit little Oh. Ooh, can I go back?

**8:36** · Can we go back one slide, please?

**8:39** · Thank you. Um so, over time, it has gotten a little bit more complex with now agents coming into the loop with like tool calls, skills, all the different ways to optimize your contacts and all that stuff. So, over time, these systems get more and more complex.

**8:52** · So, it's also way more levers that you can pull to make changes to your agents, which makes it once again then more important to have evals that forces you to have concrete way of identifying these are the things that we can change, and these are the things that impact the system in a positive So, once again, like with agents, it's the same flow, right? Um except now with just way more and way more complex things.

**9:20** · Um evals, when you create them, there's basically a few graders. A grader is what we consider basically a way how we can judge the output, right? And like one of those ways is, for example, a code-based grader, which is pretty similar to, for example, a unit test, as you might know in like software engineering, right?

**9:39** · It can be like a string match, rejects, maybe a fuzzy fuzzy match, but it's like a strict analysis, right?

**9:46** · It finds static and tool code checks and the advantages of this one is it's fast, cheap, deterministic, but it has a big drawback which is that it's brittle and it also lacks in nuance, right?

**9:59** · Um And with this we mean like especially brittle is quite an interesting one in my opinion because like these deterministic checks they force a certain deterministic behavior, right?

**10:10** · But with and sometimes this is absolutely the way we want an agent to behave, right? Like for example, let's say you have an agent that creates a slide deck for example, you want to make sure that in the end there is a slide deck present, deterministic check.

**10:25** · But then if you want to have like a check on what's the quality of the slide deck, this is way more nuanced, right?

**10:30** · Like you cannot easily encode this in like some deterministic checks, right?

**10:35** · And that's why we also have the second type of graders which is the model-based graders, right?

**10:40** · And this is like rubric-based reasoning.

**10:42** · Um So you for example say like is this slide high quality? Very generic, but that might be for example a rubric or like for example is this text coherent?

**10:55** · Also a way to get some intel on how well your agent's performing.

**11:00** · Um you can do some interesting things with this as well.

**11:03** · Um pairwise comparison is in my opinion quite underrated. Let's say you have two examples, two outputs, um and then you basically ask the model which one of the two do you prefer and why?

**11:13** · That's also quite interesting to get some information out of especially especially for these scenarios where you don't really have a clear way of of defining what makes the better one, right?

**11:24** · Um And and then another one is the multi-judge consensus which is just for example you take like best of three and you say like three judges score independently and say like majority wins for example, right? Once again, that this multi-judge consensus is interesting because it allows you to introduce some more determinism in a way where if you have like we know that an LLM is undeterministic, right?

**11:49** · And the same would be happening for this model-based graders, right? Like if you run them like 100 times, a few times it might say, "Oh, this is great." And a few other times it might say, "Ah, it's not that good." If you have like this multi-judge consensus, you basically are assuming, let's put more compute into this and let's see what the majority of our graders consensus is, right?

**12:08** · And this is unlocks a lot of things, right? Like this is flexible, this is scalable, this is nuanced.

**12:13** · But as I said, it's non-deterministic, it costs more money, and also it requires some calibration, which we will see is not easy at all.

**12:22** · And then finally, the most expensive one are the human graders. And these are probably the graders that when you're building these agentic systems, you will be using the least, right? Because they're like incredibly expensive.

**12:36** · Um you have like a whole subject matter expert that will do like a whole review of the system. It will It's expensive, it's slow as well, but it is more It's the highest quality. It is very nuanced.

**12:47** · Um and yeah, it's like really good for like some AB testing and some spot checking, right?

**12:52** · So, I'm not sure like how many of you were able to clone the repo beforehand and have this all set up. Um I actually wanted to do this session a little bit differently, but given the amount of people, I will probably do a little bit more um myself instead of like letting you um think about all of the things. Um but I'll quickly give you an overview of of what's in the repo, right? Um let me make this a little bit bigger. Um I have made some pre-made uh slides that I will show you in a bit.

**13:19** · Um The resources is the main thing where you guys would be working in. So, you have the I'm actually closing this session for now. Um so if like the agent.yaml and this is basically where you would define your agent, right? Like um I think before we did a session.

**13:34** · So this is basically what we're going to do use like the manage agent. So for the people who attended that session um before lunch, it's basically the same thing. We define here like an an an agent in this case um and we have given this uh the system prompt, right? So this is a system prompt that we're giving. So basically you are a slide generation agent and when the user gives you a topic, create a PowerPoint file at this location. And then also we tell it you have a shell um with Python PPTX uh pre-installed, right? Um so that's all we give it for now.

**14:02** · And then we also have like an environment which we've defined um with like few packages um what is it what it needs to complete this session. Um And then basically that's it. We also have some other things defined, but I will get to that. I think maybe the first question that I have for the audience today is we want to make a slide generation agent, right?

**14:24** · What do you guys think is a good eval? What are you trying to measure? What would be some good information that you want to get out of evals?

**14:36** · Sorry?

**14:38** · Number of words on slides is is it a useful uh thing to track?

**14:43** · And anyone else with some ideas?

**14:47** · Sorry?

**14:50** · Yeah, absolutely valid. Absolutely valid. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um I I And this actually I like these two examples because they immediately give you like a different sense of um how you can use the type of grades. Like for example, the number of words on a slide is quantifiable, right? It's like easy to say you can count the number of words with like a deterministic grader with like a code grader.

**15:10** · \[snorts\] The one if it's like overlapping or if it's overspilling, that one is harder to at um um encode in code, right? So for this one you might for example use a model grader. And that's exactly what we did, right?

**15:21** · So we have actually defined for you guys already a few graders beforehand.

**15:26** · Two specific directories we have the code and we have judge. So, the code one is as I said it's like these these code graders they're quite deterministic like for example if we take a look at emoji count for example is one that we have defined where we basically just count the number of emojis present in the slide deck. Um because we we just noticed that it's quite prevalent. Like for example if I open the slide deck um let me go with environment one in this case. Um so these are the slides that I it's basically the agents running.

**15:57** · Um it's it's done beforehand just because it takes can take quite a while um to get the agents running. Um but this is for example the result of the initial agents, right? So, this is slide number one. Um slide number two slide number three um with some weird things on the bottom left. Um slide four and slide five.

**16:23** · Now, I I think we can all agree like this is not the best slide deck you guys have ever seen. Um but it's a good start. At least it does a slide deck um that's five slides. I think that's exactly the prompt that we sent it. Um so we have a few slides. There's a few content on here it's like few boxes.

**16:39** · It's you know, it's a slide deck. Um given these slides is there anything else that you guys are seeing that like this is something that we would never want in a slide deck?

**16:58** · What was that? I No teal No teal. We can if you absolutely want to avoid teal that's absolutely right. I think in this it doesn't do that for every single slide. Like let me see for the career one.

**17:09** · Um let me see what it is. Oh, okay maybe it does always use teal actually. Um but for example in this one we see like this overlap of like words and and and this this horizontal what else do we have some weird coloring.

**17:23** · Yeah, there's there's there's a few weird things happening generally, right?

**17:29** · So yeah, based on this we take you take a look at what it is what the results are and you're like hmm what type of graders do I want to define for this specifically, right? And so we did that and we noticed for example emoji counts is one that's quite prevalent. We want to check how many times do we see an emoji popping up.

**17:47** · Another one is for example cluttered slides like how many shapes do we see on the slides like if there's just so too many things it becomes cluttered. Counting the number of slides for example we always ask for five slides making sure that you have five slides.

**18:02** · Do we have slides with image, small fonts, text heavy slides. Now this is this is in this case it's quite arbitrarily chosen, right? These were just like things that we like thought were like this is quite representative of what a slide deck might have for graders, right? It really depends like I want really want to stress this like it really depends from use case to use case what makes a good grader, right?

**18:23** · I think generally the way I think about this thing is if you have a grader that you get no useful out of information out of then you should not have that part of your evil, right? Like each thing you should be able to tell like for each single scenario that you're testing you should be able to say like this is the information that I want to get out of this. This is the type of this is the part of the system that I'm testing and this is how I can act on if it's being degraded, right?

**18:52** · So those were just like a few codes ones and then we also have a few judge ones for example the color judge which basically judged what's the color contrast and then it gives a score from like zero to five. Same with image, the layout, text. And this is the prompt that we give. Let me close this one real quick.

**19:14** · Oh.

**19:15** · So, let me keep it like this. So, this is basically the system prompt that we give it.

**19:20** · Um no.

**19:22** · So, we're saying, "Please evaluate the slide based on each of the following criteria. Text, the title should be simple and clear to indicate the main points. For main content, avoid too many texts and keep words concise. Use a consistent and readable font size, style, and color."

**19:36** · And I mean, it it goes on and on, right?

**19:37** · So, we give like for each of the different things that we want to measure we give like a little information of like "This is what you should be focusing on when you want to measure this." Right? Okay, cool. So, we have these evals.

**19:51** · Let's say you have now created a slide deck and you now want to see like, "Okay, what are the results, right? And how can we act on these results?" So, in this wrapper we also have created this nice little script that will automatically score your slide deck for you. And so, at the top here we basically have it all listed out. So, we have like the slide count which is being counted the slides, the number of slides with image, text-heavy slides, cluttered slides, small font size, and so on.

**20:16** · We also have our judges over here which are saying like they give a score from like zero to five uh based on like how good is the text, how good is the image at the layout and the color, right? Um uh honestly like these scores you can immediately note that these scores are quite high. So, as we said like we calibrated between zero and five. And as we see like the scores are being given you are like between 2.8 and four which honestly I think are quite high given the slide deck that we have seen, right?

**20:45** · So, that's like the part of the calibration that needs to happen as well, right? I think there's also like one thing that I maybe want to stress. It's not because you have set up your evals once that they are now like the ground truth, you know? Um evals over time they can evolve. They need to be a living artifact. It's not like something you make once and then forget and then use it like to make all of your future decisions on, right?

**21:07** · Because like we will see over time like as I go through all of the different examples that we have, we will see like there needs to be a way also how we can see how we can make sure that the evals that we create are actually still measuring something useful for us, right?

**21:21** · If you ever hear people talk about saturation of evals, that's basically what they mean in a way that like the eval is not giving any more relevant information that we can act on due to several reasons.

**21:32** · Cool.

**21:33** · So, we see this and I guess maybe the first thing that we want to do in this case is we want to make an agent that is a little bit more polished, right? And so for this, we actually just update our system prompts. So in instead of just having like, "Oh, you are slide generation agent, make a slide deck."

**21:51** · We now give it a little bit more information of like what are the expectations that we have of you in terms of typography, right? Because as we noticed, we said like, "Oh, the font is too small. There's too many words on there. It's not readable or it's too big." Right? So we give it a little bit more of information. So we say like, "Slide title should be this size, section header should be this size, body this size, caption this size."

**22:11** · Right?

**22:13** · And we also give it some information on the layout and density. Like here are the things that we expect from the layout and density point of view. For example, we say, "Keep the body text concise, leave breathing room, and left align paragraphs." Right?

**22:25** · And then also we I think everyone kind of I mean I am at least getting like ticked off like if I read something that's clearly AI written, I'm always a little bit skeptical of if I can completely trust the content and if the person sending me this text is like has like read it himself or themselves and is standing behind that content, right? So we also say like avoid these AI generated tells as well.

**22:47** · So never use a thin accent lines in the titles and don't pepper slide with emojis as decorative icons, right?

**22:53** · So this is based on the things that we have seen in our eval, right? So we have seen as I Let's go back a little bit. We've looked at this slide deck. And we're like, "Oh, this is not properly done. These fonts are a little bit off. Um, there's some emoji used in here. It's like a little bit all over the place."

**23:12** · And then based on the score, we were like, "Okay, these are the things that we're clearly failing at, right?" So, we have like emoji counts four in this case, small font slides also four as well, cluttered slides two, and text heavy slides, right? So, based on the information that we have gotten from the eval that we have run, we have made these changes to our new agent, right?

**23:31** · Let me now pull up the result of the new agent that we have created in this case, right? Um, so this is slide one, which I think is immediately way more enjoyable to look at. Like, there's no overlapping stuff. Um, there's no dollar sign. There's just generally it's cleaner.

**23:47** · This once again, I think this one still has like quite small text, but at least once again, we're like getting a little bit more consistent with the coloring as well.

**23:55** · Um, once again, like the whole slide deck is more consistent. This third slide, the fourth slide, and the fifth slide, right?

**24:03** · And this is just by basically identifying, "Here's a few failure modes of our original one. Here's how we now make changes based on these things that we found in the system prompt, and now we run it back." And now once again, we can do the same thing. So, this is we're now basically in this loop of finding what's wrong, iterating, finding what's wrong, running it again, and making improvements over time.

**24:25** · So, now we can take a look back at what we found over here. Oh, and this is actually way worse suddenly. We see like emoji count 20. I'm wondering where they are. I haven't seen them actually. Wondering where that is at.

**24:36** · Hmm.

**24:39** · Wonder if this is like a mistake in this case. Um, but generally we see like, okay, small font slides, we've seen that, but we've we've improved upon the cluttering. Um, and let's see, text heavy, is that still the case?

**24:51** · Um, I think I think that's fine. I mean, those are a little bit text heavy, but I think it's acceptable, right?

**24:59** · So, now we're like So, this once again shows the value of like human review as well, right?

**25:04** · Because now we see, oh, these things that we have defined in our evals are maybe not as well defined as we hoped them to be, right? Because now I'm here arguing like, oh, this is not as text-heavy as I expected it to be, right?

**25:15** · So, that means that something is actually wrong with the way we're grading. So, now we go back then, we would go back, go to our grader, change the grader, update it, and make sure that it better reflects the actual thing that we want to measure, right?

**25:28** · And this is also not something to be underestimated, like this calibration of how your agent should behave um and how your judges should judge the specific output is really something very fickle, right? Like you should spend like proper time trying to find the ways on how you should make this happen.

**25:45** · Um let's say now that we want to have an agent. Like I I I I think with this one, I mean, it's fun. I think it's nice, um but it's still quite text-heavy and it's only text, right? Um let's say now that we want to have an agent. Let's say that's one of our requirements, right? That we have an agent that we always want to have includes diagrams. Once again, we go back to our system prompt, we update it, and we now say every slide must include at least one generated diagram or chart inserted as an actual image, right?

**26:14** · Um so, once again, we update the system prompt or any part of the agent that you can tune, and then we go again and we check what do we get. Okay, so this one is quite interesting.

**26:28** · I'm I guess personally I'm not a fan of having an image on the opening slide, but once again, it is what we defined that it should do, right? So, I'm going to let it slide. But it's it's a nice nice graph. What is saying? It's like no negotiation and active negotiation. So, it's arguing that if you do active negotiation for your salary, you can see over time the gap widens between no negotiation and yes negotiation negotiation.

**26:51** · Some extra benchmarks. I I I this looks immediately way better just in the way that it's like kind of grounded into some actual facts right now instead of just waffling its way through the slide deck, right?

**27:04** · Yeah, this one I'm not a big fan of. I feel like it's a little bit stretched, but that might also just be the screenshot. Um Yeah, and this one also not the best one either, right?

**27:16** · Let me see like let's see what the score.json also says, okay. No emojis, great. No cluttered slides. Still quite text heavy slides surprisingly. Um still small font slide. I think that's fine. I think we just say like with images I think Yeah, I think we we accept like these types of things are fine. Um so once again, shows you some um questions regarding the grader that we have set up.

**27:41** · But now we can also take a look at like the judges, right? Like for example because now we have images that we have created, so now we can also consider how does the image judge uh I think this is. And it says it's 3.8 out of five. Um doesn't say give us a lot to go off, right? It just gives us a random number.

**27:57** · What does it mean? How can we improve upon this? But that's fine for now.

**28:02** · Now one thing that we always see that works just generally quite well, and that's like it's transversal over every single use case is adding a QA loop, right? Um for coding this is quite intuitive. That's basically saying like you create an agent that actually is writing the code, right?

**28:19** · And then you add the second agent that is then looking at the code that has been written and just criticizes it. So it's basically saying this is bad, this is bad, this is bad. This introduces a bug, this introduces a bug, this is not according to standards, whatever, right?

**28:30** · So it basically is criticizing the the thing that has been created. And then that part of the feedback you give back to your original agent, the creation agent.

**28:39** · The creation agent goes off again, does the creation, does the fine-tuning, makes the changes that were informed by the criticizing, and then once again after that is done, it goes back to the criticizing agent. And that loop basically goes on and on and on until both sides are like, "Okay, this is fine. We can ship this." And that's basically what we now do in this next step.

**29:00** · Um so, we basically say like, "Okay, require QA loop. Um assume there are no problems. Um oh, assume there are problems, and then your job is to find them. Approach QA as a bug hunt, not a confirmation step." And this is quite interesting, because we're like actively instructing the agent to behave in a way adversarially adversarially, right? Like we're saying like, "There are issues.

**29:21** · You need to find them." It's not It's not like, "Oh, there might be something. You might be interested in finding something." No, it's actively saying, "There are issues. Go find them." Um and then we say like we instruct after writing the deck, "Okay, convert it to images. Inspect every slide image yourself. Fix the issues, re-render, re-inspect, and then do not stop until you've completed at least one fixed and verified cycle."

**29:42** · Cool. Now, as I said, I think for coding this is quite intuitive, but I think it's also quite intuitive if you take a look at like um the the slides that we have created, right? Because that's basically what we did. We have looked at the slides, and we're like, "Ah, this is not good. This is not good. Let's take that feedback, update our graders, update our system prompt, and let's run it back again, right?" So, let's now see if we can actually if this is actually showing some improvements. Um I think this is immediately a lot better. So, the the the image is way bigger now.

**30:12** · I think it's way more readable even from a further distance away. Um still the slides are small, but it's like for example, it's source known. There's a source over here as well, which is quite good. Um I think this is also way better. It is more clearly structured. I think the image is also a little bit better as well, right?

**30:31** · A quite interesting graph in this case, uh your value profile versus team average. This one is still a little off in my opinion. Also, we now have like a little introduction of like these weird ticks.

**30:44** · Um And this one is also a little bit better, I would say, but I think like the just the image taking is um kind of messing with the slide here. And so then we kind of know the drill by now. We take a look at the score.

**30:56** · We see like has it improved? Why do we see still gaps? And now we see like for all of the judges that we have created, it is higher than uh the ones before, right? We're now all good in the four .2 to 4.4 now. Um so we're on a we're on a good track, right?

**31:11** · And um you can keep on doing this. You can keep on doing this. Um And you will always make like these little changes, but sometimes and this is I guess where it gets quite interesting and more like more like nuanced is you can also just go to a smarter model, right? Because like now you're like defining, oh, this is what a good slide should look like.

**31:33** · This is what it should do. This is what not what you should not do. But with these models getting smarter and better over time, you kind of expect them to be like able to figure that out on their own, right?

**31:44** · Um I mean, that would at least be nice. So, that's what we tried out as well.

**31:48** · So, now in the last one we basically just changed our model to Opus 4 7 instead of Sonnet 4 7, which we have used up to this point. If you can uh 4 6. Um So, now we have switched to Opus 4 7, and we have basically just given it a simple prompt again. Like you are a slide generation agent, and then when the user gives you a topic, create a PowerPoint file at whatever and then you have a shell. So, it's basically just the initial prompt that we gave to uh our Sonnet model in the beginning, right?

**32:17** · And then once again, let's now consider taking a look at the results of those.

**32:24** · And this is just a base prompt, right?

**32:25** · Like you can immediately see like it's significantly better than the Sonnet one, right? I think there's still clear issues that we can iron out, but generally like it's It's more structured, right?

**32:37** · And then we can take a look at the score as well. And I think this is quite interesting and quite telling. Like for example, Opus just does not use any emojis. Like it kind of knows like if you want to make a slide deck about salary increase, emojis are probably not right place to put them, right?

**32:54** · Um it also has like fewer small font slides because it's kind of has like this innate knowledge of, "Okay, it should be readable. This is how a slide deck should function. This is what people expect out of a slide deck."

**33:04** · Right?

**33:05** · And then we get to these judge graders, right?

**33:08** · Um we see a 4.4. We see a five for the images. Do we even have an image in this one? I don't think it we do actually.

**33:16** · No, we don't. Okay, but then once again, we got a five in this one. Layout judge 4.2 and then the color judge 4.8 and title body coherence 4.4. So, this is like immediately giving like extremely high scores as well, right? Which I think is quite interesting because like this is once again showing that we might not be measuring the right thing.

**33:35** · And this is not too unexpected for these types of um graders, right? Or for these judge graders. I think one of these things with like Okay, let's go to the code grades. I think those are quite straightforward. I think most people in the room would have understood by now like how they work and how what we can do with them.

**33:52** · Like for example, emoji count, it's quite simple. Just count the number of emojis and that's it. But with this judging, what we have done here is actually quite problematic. We basically say like give a score from zero to five and for text well, the text should uh the title should be simple and clear to indicate the main point for main content. Avoid too many text and keywords.

**34:14** · But it has nothing to anchor on, right?

**34:16** · Like it doesn't really know what good looks like in this case. It doesn't know what bad looks like.

**34:20** · So, there's still like this trade-off between like what does a model actually know and what do we need to give more information on to the model to make sure that it can give like a proper um proper judging of what we actually have produced, right?

**34:37** · So, for example, in this case, I would for example say what could help is say like, "Oh, this is a bad example. Like let's say you have a zero. Like everything is just awful. These are some telltale signs that you're dealing with an extremely badly formatted slide deck." And then like over time, different ranges you can kind of express.

**34:58** · And then once over time, and then once again, like that doesn't mean it will still be able to give like a good answer because we now have these results. We have this number that our LLM decided to output for some reason. Like for example, in this in this case, it just put out five.

**35:17** · Okay, what do we do with that number now? Okay, it's a five. We we we just said there was no not a single image in the slide deck, right? So, how can we interpret this five?

**35:27** · One way of doing this is just basically always asking your judge graders to give reasons why it came to that conclusion, right? And one thing that should be very like cautious about is the ordering, right?

**35:41** · I've had it happen while I was like setting this up. And I did like this exact thing. So, I had like the number and then I said like, "Okay, give me also reasons why you did that." And so then it said like, "Oh, it's a four and the reasons for this are these these and these."

**35:53** · But we know that an LLM it works auto regressively, right? So, if it is anchored on like this four, it will do anything it can to argue why it should be a four, right? Anything. Even if it's like extremely bad. If it's like if it should be like a one, it will still say, "Oh, it is good for these and these reasons." Because it needs to justify the four that it put out.

**36:13** · So, once how you do it is you actually turn it around. So, first you say like, "Give me a bunch of reasons. Give me pros. Give me cons. Give me reasons why it should be high. Give me reasons why it should be bad." And then based on all of those reasons together, then you need to make your final decision on the output, right?

**36:29** · And that's also that goes also back to like this QA loop as well. Um because then once again, you can get a little bit tricky where you have like multiple agents also doing the verification part where you have like one agent that is like finding all of the issues, and then the other one is like refuting those.

**36:45** · For example, one example that I can give, which I think is quite interesting. Let's say you want to make um a document for um where you need to like some analysis.

**36:55** · First you need to get a lot of context from the internet, for example, like on a legal document, for example, right? Um and you ask the you ask a model to like make a summary of um a certain case, what was decided, what does this have for legal implications for other cases, right?

**37:10** · You need to be very careful with like all of these things that like legal cases are generally like quite tricky. And like an agent would love to create like, "Oh, this and this." and jump to conclusions like, "This is the reason."

**37:19** · and that's it, right? And then the grader might be like, "Oh, this is unclear. This is um maybe not as this is maybe uh untrue. This is maybe uh maybe like glossing over the actual facts." All of those type of things, right?

**37:34** · But then once again, you can like apply these multiple techniques. You can have like multiple graders, for example, seeing like um evaluating those and seeing like what are the main ones popping up. Um because once again, a grader might still hallucinate things as well, right? Especially in like the very nuanced scenarios, right? So, there's like different ways of how you then can work with these judges to make sure that you actually get like good, consistent output that is actionable, right?

**37:59** · And what I've shown you here today is basically just a small introduction to how evals can help you, but it's definitely not the end. I think 45 minutes for a session on evals is, in my opinion, quite \[clears throat\] short because it can get really deep, right?

**38:15** · Because like I started this off this session with talking about benchmarks, which are in the end just evals.

**38:22** · And every single time, why would every single model provide or care so much about benchmarks, so much about evils, if it wasn't one of the main important things when we are building new models, right?

**38:36** · Exactly. We need to find the things that we are failing at. Exactly. We need to find things. What are we good at? What are we bad at? How can we make the model better in future generations? And that's the same thing when building applications that are consisting that's using AI agents, right? It's the same thing. It's just finding what works, finding what doesn't, iterating, and making sure that the changes that you're making that you're informed on the decisions that you are making, and making sure that the changes you make have actually positive influence on your final outputs. Okay. Thank you guys so much. This is all the time I have.

**39:07** · Thank you guys.
